I am a data structure independent text abstraction.

I define a public API of the text model. User must only talk with me using provided methods. My subclasses provide implementation based on concrete data structures, for example rope or string.

I only store string and corresponding attributes. I don't know anything about text layout or paragraphs. I should be used together with BrTextParagraph in order to be measured, layered out and rendered. 

Public API and Key Messages

- message one   
- message two 
- (for bonus points) how to create instances.

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
